# üåãHello EngineüññüèΩ

A real-time rendering engine built from scratch using Vulkan API and C++.

### Features
* __Clustered forward shading__.
* __Physically-Based Rendering__ (PBR) with Cook-Torrance BRDF.
* __Image-Based Lighting__ (IBL) with offscreen pipelines to generate:
    * A cubemap from an equirectangular HDR image.
    * Specular and diffuse cubemaps.
* Compute shader to generate BRDF lookup table.
* __Bindless textures__, all textures needed for rendering the entire scene are bound only once at the start of the frame.
* __Shadow maps__ with Poisson Disk or PCF.
* Reinhard tonemap postprocessing.
* glTF mesh/texture loading and rendering.
* Multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA).
* Simple __raytracing__ pipeline.
* Automatic runtime compilation from GLSL to SPIR-V using `glslang`.
* A a lightweight abstraction layer that encapsulates Vulkan API for rapid prototyping/development.
* Minor features: skybox, instancing, ImGui, SSBOs, UBOs, and push constants.

The images below shows a demo of PBR, IBL, bindless textures, and PCF shadow mapping.

Bindless textures is achieved by utilizing __Descriptor Indexing__. This enables the storage of all scene textures inside an unbounded array, which allows the texture descriptors to be bound once at the start of a frame. 

Additionally, the vertices of all 3D objects are stored inside a single buffer, which also bound in the beginning of the frame. This is known as vertex pulling.

### Clustered Forward Shading

The technique consists of two steps that are done in compute shaders. The first step is to subdivide the view frustum into AABB clusters.
The next step is light culling, where it calculates lights that intersect the clusters. This step removes lights that are too far from a fragment, leading to reduced light iteration in the final fragment shader.

Preliminary testing using a 3070M graphics card shows the technique can render a PBR Sponza scene with over 1000 dynamic lights at 60-100 FPS.
If too many lights end up inside the view frustum, especially when zooming out, there may be a drop in frame rate, but still much faster than a naive forward shading.

### Cascade Shadow Maps

<img width="850" alt="cascade_shadow_mapping" src="https://github.com/azer89/HelloVulkan/assets/790432/1634a491-ea8f-49f0-8214-766a038bedd1">

The rendering above uses four cascades which allow the shadows to be much sharper. Additionally, Poisson disk sampling is used to blur out projective aliasing. However, excessive blurring causes more noticeable seams between the cascades. There is also an issue of the shimmering edge effect because the shadow maps constantly changing everytime the camera is moved.

On the right image above, each individual cascade is color coded.

### Hardware Raytracing

A simple raytracing pipeline has also been added to the engine. This process begins with the creation of BLAS and TLAS. Subsequently, a single ray is generated for each pixel, followed by an intersection test to determine the color of the pixel. Note that light bouncing functionality is not currently implemented.
