### Engine Overview

The engine leverages several modern GPU features to optimize rendering performance. First, bindless textures is achieved by utilizing __descriptor Indexing__. This enables the storage of all scene textures inside an unbounded array, which allows texture descriptors to be bound once at the start of a frame. 

Next, the engine takes advantage of __indirect draw__ API. This means the CPU only calls a single indirect draw command. By sorting draw calls based on material type, it is now possible to have separate render passes for each material. For each render pass, the GPU only processes a draw call batch of objects sharing the same material. This significantly improves efficiency because shader branching can now be avoided.

Finally, the engine pushes the concept of "bindless" even further by utilizing __buffer device addresses__. Instead of creating descriptors, device addresses act as _pointers_ so that the shaders can have direct access to buffers.

The images below showcase the implementations of PBR, IBL, and PCF shadow mapping.

### Clustered Forward Shading

The technique consists of two steps that are executed in compute shaders. The first step is to subdivide the view frustum into AABB clusters.
The next step is light culling, where it calculates lights that intersect the clusters. This step removes lights that are too far from a fragment, leading to reduced light iteration in the final fragment shader.

Preliminary testing using a 3070M graphics card shows the technique can render a PBR Sponza scene in 2560x1600 resolution with over 1000 dynamic lights at 60-100 FPS.
If too many lights end up inside the view frustum, especially when zooming out, there may be a drop in frame rate, but still much faster than a naive forward shading.

### Compute-Based Frustum Culling

Since the engine uses indirect draw, frustum culling can now be done entirely on the compute shader by modifying draw calls within an indirect buffer. If an object's AABB falls outside the camera frustum, the compute shader will deactivate the draw call for that object. Consequently, the CPU is unaware of the number of objects actually drawn. Using Tracy profiler, an intersection test with 10,000 AABBs only takes less than 25 microseconds (0.025 milliseconds).

The left image below shows a rendering of all objects inside the frustum. The right image shows visualizations of AABBs as translucent boxes and the frustum drawn as orange lines.

### Compute-Based Skinning

The compute-based skinning approach is much simpler than the traditional vertex shader skinning. This is because the skinning computation is done only once using a compute shader at the beginning of the frame. The resulting skinned vertices are then stored in a buffer, enabling reuse for subsequent render passes like shadow mapping and lighting. Consequently, there is no need to modify existing pipelines and no extra shader permutations.

### Cascade Shadow Maps

The left image below is a rendering that uses four cascade shadow maps, resulting in sharper shadows. The right image above showcases the individual cascades with color coding. Poisson disk sampling helps to reduce projective aliasing artifacts, but can create more noticeable seams between cascades with excessive blurring.

### Hardware Raytracing

The engine also features a basic ray tracing pipeline. This process begins with building Bottom Level Acceleration Structures (BLAS) and Top Level Acceleration Structures (TLAS). For each pixel on the screen, a ray is cast and intersected with the acceleration structures to determine the final color.
